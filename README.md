# Relevant Files

The project is split into two directories: `Mars` and `SalesTax`.

Each directory has documentation in MarkDown format in the appropriate `.md` files: `SalesTax.md` and `Mars.md`.

To build the executable, run the `Makefile` in each directory.

Each directory also has unit tests in its `utest` directory. The source for those is in the higher-level directory. Unit tests may be built by running the `Makefile` in each `utest` directory.
